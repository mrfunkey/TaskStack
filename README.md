TaskStack is a simple java task manager with a stacked list containing the user's added tasks to complete.

## Task Management
Users can add, complete and delete tasks directly through the "Task Options" button located in the Task Stack panel.

### Deleting tasks
When a user deletes a task, it gets removed from the list without incrementing the completion counter.
